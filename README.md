Just Built a Travel Away App with React! ✈️
Excited to share my latest project – a Travel Wishlist App 🌍✨, built using React.js! This app helps users create and manage their dream travel destinations easily.

💡 Tech Stack Used:
✅ React.js for a smooth UI
✅ State Management for handling user inputs

✅Responsive Design for all devices

This project helped me improve my skills in React state management and UI/UX design. Looking forward to feedback and suggestions! 🚀
